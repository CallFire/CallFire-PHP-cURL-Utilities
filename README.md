# CallFire-PHP-cURL-Utilities
This file contains four functions that perform cURL GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods from PHP. Each function sets the cURL options expected by the API endpoint, adds the authentication header, builds the parameter list, and makes the API call.

To install, simply place this file in your project directory and include it in your PHP script.
